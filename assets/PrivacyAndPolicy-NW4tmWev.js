SKMADS may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the SKMADS Site. By using these cookies, we can “remember” what you have done on the SKMADS Site before and personalize our site for you. These persistent types of cookies can be removed. Each web browser implements different functionality, so please refer to the manuals or technical support resources that are available in conjunction with your web browser to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. Please note that disabling cookies, if any, may prevent you from accessing some of the functionality and offerings available via the SKMADS Site. “Automatically Collected” Information: – When you visit the SKMADS Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons”. This “automatically collected” information may include your Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), web browser type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the SKMADS Site, the pages you view on our site, and the dates and times that you visit. When your end-users connect to the Service on their mobile device, SKMADS may automatically receive from their mobile phone service provider information identifying their unique mobile device, their phone number, and/or other unique identifiers for their device (“Mobile Device Information”). For the avoidance of doubt, your end users are not “Users” covered by this Privacy Policy, and any information that you collect from your end users is governed by your privacy policy if any, and not this Privacy Policy.
    “Retargeting” – SKMADS uses retargeting technologies on the internet. This enables us to reach those internet users with advertising who were already interested in our services. The retargeting advertisements are shown on a cookie-based analysis of user behavior. Naturally, there will be no personal data saved and the usage of retargeting technology is affected under consideration of effective legal privacy policies.
